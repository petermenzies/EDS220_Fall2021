### Snow Lab 1

Hi Everyone! Todays lab will be running an energy balance model to estimate how much water is in a snow pack.  We will use remote sensing measurements
from a field station on Mammoth Mountain. 

Apart from the science, the goal of the lab is to get comfortable in python with the following:
* importing a csv of data into python
* indexing datasets
* math on data in python
* datatypes in python
* plotting in python
* exploring a dataset in python
* more farmiliarty with pandas dataframes, a very powerful data science tool
* using binder
* ways to publish code and final products for others to see

The lab github page it here:

feel free to fork it if you want

Alternativly, you can fire up the binder session directly through this link:

more information on mybinder (in case you want to use for future projects) is here:

### Sam will send a Zoom link for the live lab session
