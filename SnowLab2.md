### Snow Lab 2

Hi Everyone! Todays lab will be playing with space/time datacubes of AMSR-E (passive microwave satellite) and ERA-5 (global climate model) SWE estimates. 

Apart from the science, the goal of the lab is to get comfortable in python with the following:
* importing and using datacubes
* understading where files are and how to load them into python
* indexing datasets
* math on data in python
* datatypes in python
* plotting in python
* exploring a dataset in python
* understanding dimensions of datasets
* using binder
* converting between coordiante systems
* plotting with basemaps
* interpolatings nosiy data

feel free to fork it if you want

Alternativly, you can fire up the binder session directly through this link:

### Sam will send a Zoom link for the live lab session
